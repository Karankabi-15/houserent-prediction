## Project Description: Predicting House Rent Prices Using Decision Trees

### Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using decision trees to predict house rent prices based on various features of the houses. This model aims to provide accurate and interpretable predictions that can be used by landlords, real estate agents, and potential renters to make informed decisions.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to houses and their respective rent prices. These features may include:

- Location (e.g., city, neighborhood)
- Size (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms)
- Amenities (e.g., presence of a garden, parking, swimming pool)
- Age of the house
- Type of house (e.g., apartment, detached house)
- Proximity to facilities (e.g., schools, public transport, shopping centers)

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the distribution of rent prices.
   - Visualize relationships between features and rent prices using scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.
   - Identify and handle outliers.

3. **Model Building:**
   - **Decision Tree Regressor:** Implement a decision tree regressor to model the relationship between the features and the rent prices.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the decision tree by tuning hyperparameters such as the maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, and splitting criteria.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
   - **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

5. **Model Interpretation:**
   - Visualize the decision tree to understand how the model makes predictions.
   - Analyze feature importance to identify which features have the most significant impact on rent prices.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Implement the trained model in a web application or API that allows users to input house features and receive rent price predictions.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Data manipulation and analysis: pandas, numpy
  - Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis and model building

### Expected Outcomes
- A well-trained decision tree model capable of predicting house rent prices with reasonable accuracy.
- Insights into the factors that influence rent prices the most.
- An easy-to-use interface for making predictions based on new data inputs.

### Conclusion
This project leverages the power of decision trees to build an interpretable and effective model for predicting house rent prices. By understanding the key drivers of rent prices, stakeholders can make better decisions, optimize their strategies, and improve their market understanding.
